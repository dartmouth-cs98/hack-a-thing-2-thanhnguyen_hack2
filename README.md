# Hack-a-thing 2

By Thanh Nguyen Jr

Team: Decode Social

## Short description of what you attempted to build

In this project, I implemented a basic Node.js and Express RESTful API connected to a Mongo database.

## Who did what (if you worked with someone else)

I worked on this project on my own.

## What you learned

I learned that MongoDB is the database that our team will want to use for our project. I also learned how to setup a project with Node + Express + Yarn and also a Mongo database. I was able to connect the RESTful api with the Mongo database. I also learned how to set up this project using TypeScript rather than JavaScript.

## How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your project

For our team's project, we will have to store some data in a database and after some research we have decided that a NoSQL databse like Mongo suits our needs.

## What didnâ€™t work

I would say that this hack-a-thing went pretty well. I refreshed my understanding of RESTful apis and Express, and I also spent a lot of time brainstorming how to set up the server for our team's project.
