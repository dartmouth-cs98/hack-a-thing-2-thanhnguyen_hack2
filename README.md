# Hack-a-thing 2

By Thanh Nguyen Jr

Team: Decode Social

In this project, I implemented a basic Node.js and Express RESTful API connected to a Mongo database.
For our team's project, we will have to store some data and after some research we have decided that a NoSQL databse like Mongo suits our needs.
